# Implexis-AI

We are Implexis AI and we are using AI to unite people through consensus.

How many times have we watched a political debate and realized that no meaningful discussion is happening? How often have people chosen disrespect instead of listening?
The best way of peacemaking and progress is by deliberation and consensus.
But social media companies have made this impossible because they have created a social network for us that is not reflective of our communities.
If we donâ€™t find a solution sooner, disrespect can turn into violence, the absence of consensus can lead to a dysfunctioning government.
And simple customization can danger democracy.

At Implexis AI, our solution is to provide separate viewpoints on the same platform which will solve the issue of echo chambers.
Our team has all been personally affected by bias in our social media feed since a young age, we recognise the dangers that this could bring to our society, and we are committed to address it.

# Data Models
We tried 4 different models and compared their MCC scores which basically takes into account Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Specificity
The best model was Bert Finetuning - it is a machine learning technique for Natural Language Processing and it is already pre-trained on a huge english dataset which allows it to learn better from our smaller dataset. Additionally, it also works well with longer input unlike models like Recurrent Neural Networks
Another important model we tried was Naive Bayes which is a classic technique and was helpful in setting a baseline for our models

# Conclusion
Social media is created for the purpose of connecting people however, it is dividing them further apart instead. 
While making us feel safer in our bubbles, it is keeping us from bringing our ideas to the same table.
But what if we could create way for people to connect, beyond these bubbles.
What if, finally, with the use of AI, we could create an opportunity, for world, to stop, and listen, to the voices of those who have been lost in the echo chambers? and perhaps only then humanity will be able to make Peace.
